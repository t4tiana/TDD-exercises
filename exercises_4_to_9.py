'''4. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:'''
user_input = input('Go ahead and provide a list of numbers: ').split(',')
lst = []
for item in user_input:
  try:

  except ValueError:
    print ('Only your numbers are validated below.')
  else:

'''5. Define a class which has at least two methods:

getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also include simple test function to test the class methods.'''

class Practice:
  def __init__(self):
    self.str1 = None

'''6. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [2*C*D / H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:

C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180
Output = 18,22,24'''

'''7. Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5:
Then, the output of the program should be:
